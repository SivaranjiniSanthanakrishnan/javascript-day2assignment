Types of Datatypes
1. Primitive Datatype : Number, String, Boolean
2. Non-primitive Datatype : Array, Object

1. Copy by Value 
    => Take different value for different reference
2. Copy by reference 
    => Take same value for for all the assigned references 
    => Non primitive Datatypes behave Copy by reference 
    => To overcome Copy by reference we can use Spread Operator 
3. Scope (let, var, const)
    => let : let is a block / local scope
        a. Declarations are only block scope, 
        If initialized in inner scope it can be accessed in the outer scope where declared (Example 1)
        b. Let can't be re-declared, It can be re-assigned 
    => var : var is a global scope 
        a. var can be re-declared and re-assigned 
    => const : const is a block / local scope
        a. Declaration and Initialization should happen at the same line 
        b. const can't be re-assigned
