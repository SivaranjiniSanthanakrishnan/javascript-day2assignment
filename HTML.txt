1. HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language 
    => HTML is a markup language which is used for web page design.
    => HTML language is supported by Browser, no need of Installation for HTML 
    => HTML5 is released on January 2008. 

2. Difference between HTML and HTML5 
    => HTML will use Browser cache; HTML5 will use Application cache, webSQL, Manifest.
        a. Speed 
        b. Loads Webpage after first time without network, because page is loaded from cache (Offline Browsing)
    => IE and other old browsers won't support HTML5 

3. New Tags Introduced in HTML5

    => Figure 
    => Audio 
    => Video 
    => Strong

    => Anchor Tag 
    => Image tag 
    => Div, P, head, title, title logo (link), h1... h5, br, b, i, u, strong, strike, span, List, table  

5. Attribute 
    => Properties which is given to tag. 
    => Tag behaves based on the attributes we gave. 
    => Attributes is a predefined keyword 

6. Semantic Elements : Clearly defines about its content (Eg: <form>, <table>, <article>)
7. Non Semantic Elements : Tells nothing about its content (Eg: <div>, <span>, <p>, <nav>)

8. Inline elements : An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    Eg., Span, input fields 
9. Block Elements : A block-level element always starts on a new line. Block element takes up the entire width in the line.
    Eg., div, p 

10. Div 
    => Used to divide the content.
    => Groups the block of content / tags and can apply css especially to that block.
11. Article 
    => Group of content is written inside Article
    => Article is independennt to other contents and can be removed 
        and placed in other site without any design/content pitfall
12. Section
    => Article can be splitted into multiple sections for better understanding 
    => Sections should conntain Heading and the body of the content. 

13. HTML Forms 
    input types:
        1. text 
        2. email

CSS : Cascading Style Sheets
    => Used for designing the webpage, with multiple properties 

Types :
    1. Inline CSS  : Applying style in the tag itself
    2. Internal CSS : Applying style in head element
    3. External CSS : Applying css in the external css file and link in the HTML file 
    => Inline CSS takes more priority than Internal and External CSS
    => Internal and External CSS takes the order in which it is placed, the last written 
        CSS overwrites the previous one.  

Selectors : 
    1. Tag Selector : Selects the element with tag name
    2. Id Selector : Selects the element with it's id. Use # symbol to select.
    3. Class Selector : Selects the element with it's class name. Use . symbol to select.
    4. Universal Selector : Selects all the element in HTML page. Use * symbol to select.
    => If a element has all id, class and tag selector, id selector will take the first 
        priority over the others.
    => If a element has Class, tag and Universal Selector, class selector will take more 
        priority
