7. Non Semantic Elements : Tells nothing about its content (Eg: <div>, <span>, <p>, <nav>)

    Eg., Span, input fields 
9. Block Elements : A block-level element always starts on a new line. Block element takes up the entire width in the line.
    Eg., div, p 

10. Div

    => Groups the block of content / tags and can apply css especially to that block.
11. Article 
    => Group of content is written inside Article
    => Article is independennt to other contents and can be removed 
        and placed in other site without any design/content pitfall
12. Section

    => Sections should conntain Heading and the body of the content.

CSS : Cascading Style Sheets
    => Used for designing the webpage, with multiple properties 

Types :
    1. Inline CSS  : Applying style in the tag itself
    2. Internal CSS : Applying style in head element
    3. External CSS : Applying css in the external css file and link in the HTML file 
    => Inline CSS takes more priority than Internal and External CSS
    => Internal and External CSS takes the order in which it is placed, the last written 
        CSS overwrites the previous one.  

Selectors : 
    1. Tag Selector : Selects the element with tag name
    2. Id Selector : Selects the element with it's id. Use # symbol to select.
    3. Class Selector : Selects the element with it's class name. Use . symbol to select.
    4. Universal Selector : Selects all the element in HTML page. Use * symbol to select.
    => If a element has all id, class and tag selector, id selector will take the first 
        priority over the others.
    => If a element has Class, tag and Universal Selector, class selector will take more 
        priority
